# Isomorphic React Redux boilerplate

## This branch contains the solutions 1 and 2 of the exercise

## Exercise:

1. The server side needs a store. Where would you add a <Provider store={store}> ? Hint, it should be somewhere in the src/server folder.   

2. On the client the Redux store needs to be initialized with the same data as the store on the server. Please initialize the store on the client with the same data. Hint, this is specific just for the client, so in which folder should it be?

3. Create a new page (http://localhost:3456/posts) with a container and a component to display a list of posts, you can use this data (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Data should render server-side and client-side as the Photos component.

4. Include in the new 'Posts' page a section that displays 5 pictures called "popular pictures". Hint, are you fetching all the data (pictures and posts) on the server-side?
